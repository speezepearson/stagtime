    # Here are the functions for generating random numbers in general:

    # Linear Congruential Generator, returns random integer in {1, ..., IM-1}.
    # This is ran0 from Numerical Recipes and has a period of ~2 billion.

    # Every TagTime gap must be an integer number of seconds not less than 1
    def gap(self):
        return max(1, round(self.exprand(GAP)))





    # And here are the functions to compute successive ping times:

    # Return unixtime of the next ping. First call init(t) and then call this in
    # succession to get all the pings starting with the first one after time t.

    # Start at the beginning of time and walk forward till we hit the first ping
    # strictly after time t. Then scooch the state back a step and return the first
    # ping *before* (or equal to) t. Then we're ready to call nextping().
    def init(self, t):

        return self.pung                          # return most recent ping time <= t


    # Protypical usage is like so:

    # p = init(now)
    # print "Welcome to TagTime! Last ping would've been at time {p}."
    # repeat forever: \
    # p = nextping()
    # while now < p: wait
    # print "PING! What are you doing right now, at time {p}?"
